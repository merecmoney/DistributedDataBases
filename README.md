# Distributed Data Bases

### Practices of Relational Distributed DataBases Course
- Practice 1: Given a Problem where Database has 2 nodes, create 
Fragmentation Scheme for Database, define relational algebrea to 
fragment each table, write Reconstruction Expressions and create 
Relational Model for each node using Crow's foot notation.

#### Relational Model for Node 1 called s1

#### Relational Model for Node 2 called s2

- Practice 2: According to Practice 1, create distributed database
defining tables, constraints, some data
and queries to retrieve information as name assign to constraints,
number of rows for each table and tables defined for each node.
